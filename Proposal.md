##Session Title:
Using Gradle as the glue between legacy software and modern DevOps automation
Session Description (abstract):
For software companies that predate the internet as well as the invention of modern cloud computing the benefits of modern DevOps techniques can seem like an unobtainable dream.  This talk will go over how one company was able to use Gradle to automate the "impossible" to realize many of the benefits of DevOps for a legacy Software suite.
Using custom Gradle plugins we were able to:
* Automate the creation of reproducible environments for development and testing.
* Create a simple cost effective method of enforcing software license compliance.
* Convert our many of our manual test cases into BDDs.
* Convert our release process from a 3 week manual effort to a 12 hour no touch process.

Hopefully this presentation will inspire other development teams that automating processes for legacy applications is not only possible, but can be achieved quickly with minimal effort if you use the correct tool.
